Let's review the key findings from my master's degree thesis, Analyzing Inter-Federative Governance in Policy Implementation: The Cases of Primary Healthcare and Basic Education in Brazil.

## Context: The Brazilian Education and Health Systems

Brazil's power structure has been divided vertically among various governmental levels since the 1988 Constitution (CF/88), leading to challenges in education and health sectors.

## Literature Review

Federalism's role in policy-making is explored, considering its complex nature and worldwide diversity in federal structures.


## Key Findings

The thesis investigates public governance coordination in Brazil's federalism, focusing on healthcare and education.

* Healthcare: The Unified Health System (SUS) introduced in 1990 has a well-defined governance process but faces challenges in regionalization.
* Education: Many attempts to instate a national education system have been made, but none have been officially implemented.

### Challenges and Opportunities

* Healthcare: Challenges include moving from municipalization to regionalization.
* Education: Challenges include unclear responsibilities, policy overlaps, heterogeneity, and insufficient coordination.

## Conclusions

The thesis provides valuable insights into public governance coordination processes in Brazil, focusing on healthcare and education. Collaboration between different levels of government is essential, and the study offers a complex systems viewpoint.
